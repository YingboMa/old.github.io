# The First Two Weeks

The focus of my GSoC project changed a bit. There is a serious performance
issue in `ModelingToolkit.jl` as reported in [this
issue](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ModelingToolkit.jl/issues/62). Chris
decided to to `Reduce.jl` as a backend for `ModelingToolkit.jl`, and currently
@chakravala, the author of the `Reduce.jl` package is working on
`ModelingToolkit.jl`. After talking with my mentor Chris, I plan to work on
Nordsieck formulation after finishing the stiffness detection and automatic
switching algorithm.

In the first two weeks, I almost finished the stiffness detection and automatic
switching algorithm. After the release which has such functionality, I am ready
for fixing subtle bugs that are found by its users.

Nordsieck formulation is used by the infamous `CVODE` in `SUNDIALS`. However,
there is no such implementation in pure Julia yet. With a pure Julia
implementation one can seamlessly use native Julia types on the solve, because
of the power of generic programming.
